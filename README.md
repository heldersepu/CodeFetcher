## SETTINGS
To override the default settings use CodeFetcher.ini, it should be place in the same directory as CodeFetcher.exe, setting below:

### Location
The directories you want to search, default is the directory where the CodeFetcher.exe is. You can also specify a semicolon-separated list, i.e: 
```
C:\Users\admin\Documents\Pictures;C:\Users\admin\Documents\Videos
```
Relative paths can also be used, they are relative to CodeFetcher.exe, i.e. Documents;Pictures or ..\Documents
```
Search Directory=C:\Users\admin\Documents\
```
Where to store the lucene index, default is the SearchIndex directory where the CodeFetcher.exe is
```
Search Index=C:\TMP\Index
```
If you want  the indexer to skip certain paths. The list must be semicolon-separated.
```
Paths To Skip=c:\$Recycle.Bin
```
Search patterns separated by semicolons, the default is *.*
```
Search Patterns=*.doc;*.docx
```

### [Index]
The maximum file size to index in megabytes, default is 20mb
```
Max Size=20
```
The maximum zip file to index in megabytes, default is 5mb
```
Zip Max Size=5
```

### [Results]
The maximum results to display, default is 200
```
Max Result=200
```

### [Options]
By default the indexes don't have full paths to ensure portability on USB's and in Dropboxes
If you have multiple search paths each path will be searched to see if the file exists before opening
To have full paths, i.e. C:\Users\Admin\Documents, set this to False
```
Portable Paths=False
```
